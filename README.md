### Hi, I'm Megan! 

<br>I'm an aspiring Data Scientist/Software Engineer from Malaysia, studying Information Systems at Singapore Management University.
<br>
I am an intern at [Levels Ventures](levelsventures.com), researching Digital Twins and understanding its benefits for Smart Cities.<br>
I volunteer for [The OpenCode Foundation](https://www.theopencode.org/) and am a member of the [Coronavirus Visualization Team](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cvt/teams-and-projects).
<br>
Off the screen, I like reading and listening to music.
