### Hi, I'm Megan! 

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist/Software Engineer from Malaysia, studying Information Systems at Singapore Management University.
<br>
I interned at [Levels Ventures](https://www.levelsventures.com/), researching Digital Twins for Smart Cities. You can view my research [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f9DM11SFwiSt-xNGC5yZEYx3bxtZhpWU/view).<br>
I volunteer for [The OpenCode Foundation](https://www.theopencode.org/) and am a member of the [Coronavirus Visualization Team](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cvt/teams-and-projects).
<br>
Off the screen, I like reading and listening to music.
